## Requirements

To run the Health Management App, you'll need the following dependencies:

1. streamlit - for the web application framework.
2. google-generativeai - for leveraging AI capabilities.
3. python-dotenv - for managing environment variables.

## Configuration

To configure the app, set up the `.env` file with the necessary environment variables such as API keys and database configurations.

## Installation

To install the Health Management App, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Navigate to the app's directory.
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required dependencies.

## Steps to Setup and Run

### Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment

A virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate by creating isolated environments for them.

To create a virtual environment, navigate to the directory where you want to create your environment and run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python -m venv myenv
```

This will create a new directory named `myenv` in your current directory. This is your new virtual environment.

### Step 2: Activate the Virtual Environment

After you've created a virtual environment, you'll need to activate it.

If you're using Windows, you can do this by running the following command in cmd.exe:

```bash
myenv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

### Step 3: Navigate to the Project Directory

Navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command:

```bash
cd path_of_project_directory
```

Replace `path_of_project_directory` with the actual path to your project directory.

### Step 4: Install Required Dependencies

This project comes with a `requirements.txt` file, which contains a list of all the Python dependencies needed to run the project.

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 5: Run the Application

The project can be run using Streamlit. If you've installed all the dependencies correctly, you can start the project by running the following command:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

This will start the server, and you can navigate to the URL provided in the console to view the application.

## Usage
